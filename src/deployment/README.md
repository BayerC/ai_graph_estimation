# Ai Graph Estimation

This is a machine learning application that estimates graph types from images using a trained FastAI model. The model can classify different types of mathematical graphs (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) from uploaded images.

## Usage

Simply upload an image of a graph and the model will predict what type of graph it is.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample images demonstrating different graph types:
- `linear.png` - Linear function example
- `quadratic.png` - Quadratic function example
- `cubic.png` - Cubic function example
